# Hi, I’m Yorgo Aoun  
**“If something can be automated, I’ll automate it.”**

### Application Analyst @ **Bedrock Streaming**  
Automation enthusiast · Go adventurer · Cloud, CI/CD & Observability explorer  
ISTQB® Certified (CTFL v4.0) · Preparing for Automation Engineering certification

## 👋 About Me
Application Analyst & QA Automation Engineer focusing on **backend QA tooling**, **process automation**, **ad-tech flows**, and **observability**.  
I build internal tools that speed up QA, improve reliability, and provide technical visibility across streaming platforms.

# 🧩 What I Do

## 🧪 Multi-platform Test Automation
- **Playwright** tests for operator OTT boxes (Free, Orange, Vodafone…)  
- **Robot Framework** with Selenium (web) + Appium (mobile), fully Dockerized  
- Python tools to migrate legacy test systems (ReferTest → Squash)

## 🔧 Backend Tooling & QA Automation
- Developer of **Proxy Alchemist** — Go-based MITM proxy for VAST/VMAP ad traffic  
- Request inspection, wrapper tracking, pixel analysis, AdTagURI rewriting  
- Structured logging with IDs (vmap_uid, vast_uid, ad_uid, trk_uid)  
- Complete **New Relic instrumentation** (custom events, timings, traces)

## 🔁 Workflow Automation
- **Airtable JS/TS automations** for QA orchestration  
- **n8n workflows** generating test cases, release summaries, PO notifications  
- Airtable ↔ Target Process sync API for automated bug management

---

# ☁️ Cloud, DevOps & Observability

## AWS
- **S3** for structured proxy logs  
- **IAM** roles with least-privilege access  
- **Glue + Athena** for querying ad logs via SQL  
- **Superset** dashboards for analytics across QA, Product, and AdTech teams  

## Kubernetes & Docker
- Multi-stage Docker builds for proxy and automation stacks  
- K8s deployment with Ingress, probes, ConfigMaps, Secrets  

## CI/CD
- GitHub Actions pipelines: lint, race tests, builds, Docker image pushes, deployments  

## Terraform
- S3 buckets, IAM roles, Glue schemas, K8s manifests (Helm)  

## New Relic
- Custom telemetry for wrapper depth, timings, ad paths, pixel results  
- Correlation via hierarchical tracking IDs  
- Request-level tracing across proxy flows
