## 👋 About Me
Application Analyst & QA Automation Engineer focusing on **backend QA tooling**, **process automation**, **ad-tech flows**, and **observability**.  
I build tools that speed up QA, improve reliability, and provide technical visibility across streaming platforms.

# 🧩 What I Do

## 🔧 Backend Tooling & QA Automation
- Developer of **Proxy Alchemist** — a Go-based MITM proxy for VAST/VMAP ad traffic  
- Request inspection, wrapper tracking, pixel analysis, AdTagURI rewriting  
- Structured logging with tracking IDs (vmap_uid, vast_uid, ad_uid, trk_uid)  
- Full **New Relic instrumentation** (logs, custom events, timings, traces)

### 🧪 Multi-platform Test Automation
- **Playwright** tests for operator OTT boxes (Free, Orange, Vodafone…)  
- **Robot Framework** with Selenium (web) + Appium (mobile), all Dockerized  
- Python tools to migrate legacy test systems (ReferTest → Squash)

### 🔁 Workflow Automation
- **Airtable JS/TS scripts** for QA orchestration  
- **n8n workflows** generating test cases, weekly release summaries, PO flows  
- Airtable ↔ Target Process sync API for bug management

# ☁️ Cloud, DevOps & Observability

## AWS
- **S3**: structured proxy logs  
- **IAM**: least-privilege roles per environment  
- **Glue + Athena**: querying ad logs via SQL  
- **Superset** dashboards for QA/Product/AdTech analytics  

## Kubernetes & Docker
- Multi-stage Docker builds for proxy & automation tools  
- K8s deployment with Ingress, probes, ConfigMaps, Secrets  

## CI/CD
- GitHub Actions pipelines: lint, race tests, builds, image push, deploy  

## Terraform
- S3 buckets, IAM roles, Glue schemas, K8s components  

## New Relic
- Custom telemetry: wrapper depth, timings, ad paths, pixel results  
- Log/event correlation via hierarchical IDs
